## Getting Started <a name="intro"></a>

In order to get started, you should have the following:

	- A computing device (Tablet, PC, or Smartphone)
	with decent software support.
	- Access to uninterrupted Wi-Fi
	- Photos/footage of your beloved bus
	- A lot of free time

### Recommended Software <a name="recom-software"></a>

The following software is either web-based or can be easily
downloaded through something such as the app store.

	- CapCut (Video editing + Templates)
	- Google Drive 
		- Keep bus footage + posts here
	- Photopea/GIMP (Photo Editors)


## General Advice <a name="advice"></a>

This section details various pieces of advice from admin:

	- If you are not immediately rewarded, do not panic.
		- This is generally solid advice towards anything you do in life,
		but especially in content creation. Just keep producing content, and be patient.
	- Be consistent.
		- Self-explanatory.
	- Do not take a successful post as a sign to keep making more like it.
		- If there's a successful post that you made, please do not take it 
		as a sign to make more content using that format. It's unoriginal and bland.
	- Stick to a shtick
		- Related to consistency. Have some form of continuity. If you diverge too much
		from what you initially started with, you will lose followers.
